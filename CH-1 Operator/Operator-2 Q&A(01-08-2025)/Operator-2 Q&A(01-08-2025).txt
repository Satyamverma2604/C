Q-1
-------
          Without using control statements Write a C program to determine the next or previous multiple of 10 for a given two-digit number. 
          The program should follow these rules:
          If the last digit of the given number is greater than or equal to 5, the program should print the next multiple of 10.
          If the last digit of the given number is less than 5, the program should print the previous multiple of 10..


Sample Input1  : int a = 34;
Sample Output1 : 30 

Sample Input2  : int  a = 25;
Output2 : 30

Sample Input3  : int a = 86;
Sample Output3 : 90


Q-2
------
Write a 'C' program to check and print that given number is even or odd without using ternary operator and control statements.


Sample input : int a = 10
Sample Output : EVEN

Sample input : int a = 125
Sample Output : ODD


Q-3
------
Write a 'C' program to take the number of days and convert into (days:months:years)

Sample input  : int days = 500

Sample Output :  1 year 4 month and 15 days. 

Q-4
-------
Write a 'C' program to take the number of seconds and convert into (H:M:S)
-------

Sample input  : int seconds = 3665

Sample Output : 1 hour 1 minute and 5 second



#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int n;
printf("Enter a two digit number : ");
scanf("%d",&n);
int lastDigit = n%10,Ans;

Ans = (lastDigit>=5?  ((n/10)+1)*10:  ((n/10))*10);
printf("The round number is : %d", Ans);

}

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int n;
printf("Enter a two digit number : ");
scanf("%d",&n);

(n%2==0) && printf("%d It is an even number",n)||printf("%dIt is an odd number",n);
}

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int n;
printf("Enter a number to convert it into years , months and Days : ");
scanf("%d",&n);
int year,month,day;
year = n/365;
n= n - 365*year;
month = n/12;
n = n - month*12;
day = n;
printf("The Answer is %d Year, %d Months , %d Days",year,month,day);

}
  
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int n;
printf("Enter a number to convert it into Hours , minutes and Seconds : ");
scanf("%d",&n);
int hour,min,sec;
hour = n/3600;
n = n - hour*3600;
min = n/60;
n = n - min*60;
sec = n;
printf("The Answer is %d Hour, %d Minutes , %d Seconds",hour,min,sec);

}
