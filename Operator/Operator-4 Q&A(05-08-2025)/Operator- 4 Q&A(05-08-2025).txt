Question.1


Payroll_System

Devlop a program on a payroll system for a company. The system needs to calculate the salary of an employee based on their employee type ('M' for manager or 'H' for HR employee) and their basic salary. 
For managers, their salary should be increased by 10% as a performance bonus and for HR  increased by 5% . Write a C program that takes the employee type and basic salary as inputs and calculates the increased salary using the ternary operator.

 Test Cases:

Input: M, 50000      → Output: Final Salary with 10% bonus = 55000.00  
Input: H, 40000      → Output: Final Salary with 5% bonus = 42000.00  
Input: X, 30000      → Output: Invalid Employee Type. Salary unchanged = 30000.00  
Sample Input
M 50000
Sample Output
Final Salary with 10% bonus = 55000.00
Explanation
Explanation Input Handling: The program takes employee type (M or H) and basic salary as input. A space before %c in scanf(" %c", &empType) ensures correct character input (avoids issues with leftover \n). Bonus Calculation (Using Ternary Operator): If empType == 'M', salary is increased by 10% (basicSalary * 1.10). If empType == 'H', salary is increased by 5% (basicSalary * 1.05). For any other input, the salary remains unchanged. Output: Prints the final salary with the appropriate bonus message. If the employee type is invalid, it displays an error message.




Question.2


Check_Positive_or_Negative
Write a C program that takes an integer as input and checks if it is a positive, negative, or zero. 
Display the appropriate message as output using the ternary operator.

 Test Cases:
Input: 10       → Output: Positive Number  
Input: -5       → Output: Negative Number  
Input: 0        → Output: Zero 
give the above program with test cases?
Sample Input
10
Sample Output
Positive Number


Question.3


Calculates_ Discount
Using ternary operator write a C program for a bookstore named "BookWorld" that calculates the discounted amount based on the total purchase amount. 

The store provides three types of discounts to its customers:
-> If the total purchase amount is less than Rs. 1000, there is no discount.
-> If the total purchase amount is between Rs. 1000 and Rs. 5000 (inclusive), customers get a 5% discount on the total purchase amount.
-> If the total purchase amount is greater than Rs. 5000, customers get a 10% discount on the total purchase amount.

Sample input  : purchase amount = 999
Sample output : total amount = 999

Sample input  : purchase amount = 2000
Sample output : total amount including 5% discount = 1900

Sample input  : purchase amount = 10000
Sample output : total amount including 10% discount = 9000
Sample Input
2000
Sample Output
1900


Question 4.


Sum_Of _N_Natural_Numbers
Write a Cprogram to print sum of N natural numbers without using loops.

Sample input : int n = 10
Sample output : 55

Input: 10        → Output: 55  
Input: 5         → Output: 15  
Input: 0         → Output: 0  
Sample Input
10
Sample Output
55
