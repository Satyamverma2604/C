Question 1.


Employee Attendance Check
A company decides to reward employees with a bonus if their monthly attendance is satisfactory. An employee is eligible for the bonus if their attendance percentage is greater than or equal to 75%.

Given the total number of working days in a month and the number of days the employee was present, write a program to determine whether the employee is eligible for the bonus.

Take two inputs: presentDays and totalDays.
If attendance is >= 75%, employee is eligible for bonus.

Input Format:
------------------
Take two inputs: presentDays and totalDays.
If attendance is >= 75%, employee is eligible for bonus.


Print "Eligible for bonus" if attendance percentage is ≥ 75%.

Output Format:
-------------------
Print "Not eligible for bonus" if attendance percentage is < 75%.
Sample Input
20 16
Sample Output
Eligible for bonus
Constraints:
0 <= presentDays <= 1000

1 <= totalDays <= 1000



Question 2.


Speeding Fine System
A traffic monitoring system is used to calculate fines based on a vehicle's speed.

The speed limit is set to 60 km/h.

If a vehicle exceeds the speed limit, the following fines are applied:

Speed > 60 and ≤ 80 → ₹100 fine

Speed > 80 → ₹500 fine

Speed ≤ 60 → No fine

Given the speed of a vehicle, write a program to determine the appropriate fine.

Input Format :
A single integer speed — the speed of the vehicle in km/h.

Output Format :

"₹100" if speed is more than 60 and up to 80.
"₹500" if speed is more than 80.
"No fine" if speed is 60 or less.
Sample Input
65
Sample Output
100
Constraints:
0 ≤ speed ≤ 300
Explanation
Explanation: Input: 65 Since 65 > 60 and ≤ 80 → Fine is ₹100 Input: 85 Since 85 > 80 → Fine is ₹500 Input: 50 Since 50 ≤ 60 → No fine




Question 3. 


Uppercase to Lowercase
Write a c program to determine if a character is uppercase or lowercase using the ternary operator.
Sample Input
A
Sample Output
A is an uppercase letter.



Question 4. 


LEAP_YEAR_PROGRAM
Develop a program to check whether a given year is a leap year or not, using logical operators and the ternary operator. 

Leap Year Rule:
----------------------
A year is a leap year if it satisfies:

Divisible by 4 AND not divisible by 100,
OR
Divisible by 400
Sample Input
2020
Sample Output
Leap Year
Constraints:
An integer value representing the year (e.g., 2020)
Leap Year or Not a Leap Year
Explanation
Leap Year Rules Explained: Divisible by 4 → Leap Year Most years that are divisible by 4 are leap years. Example: 2016, 2020, 2024 Except Century Years (ending in 00) → Must also be divisible by 400 Century years (like 1900, 2000, 2100) are only leap years if divisible by 400. Reason: To correct the over-adjustment caused by adding a leap day every 4 years (which slightly overcompensates for the actual solar year).


Question 5.

Mobile Recharge Plan
A telecom company offers three different monthly data plans based on user data consumption. Your task is to write a program that suggests the correct plan based on the user's monthly data usage (in GB).

The plan selection rules are:

If usage is less than 2 GB → Plan A: ₹199/month

If usage is 2 GB to less than 10 GB → Plan B: ₹399/month

If usage is 10 GB or more → Plan C: ₹599/month

You must use the ternary operator to determine and display the recommended plan and its cost.

 Input Format :
A single integer usage — the user's monthly data usage in GB.

Output Format :
Print the recommended plan in the format:
"Plan A - ₹199"
"Plan B - ₹399"
"Plan C - ₹599"
Sample Input
1
Sample Output
Plan A - RS. 199
Constraints:
0 ≤ usage ≤ 100
Explanation
Input: 1 1 GB < 2 GB → Plan A is recommended Input: 5 5 GB falls between 2 and 10 → Plan B is recommended Input: 15 15 GB is ≥ 10 GB → Plan C is recommended
