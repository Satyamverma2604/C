Question 1.

CompareTwoNumber

Create a C program that reads two integers from the user and prints "Equal" if they are equal, and "Not Equal" otherwise.(Use only if)
Sample Input
Input as :
Enter a number : 10 10
Sample Output
Output as :
Equal


Question 2.

NumberDivisible
Write a C program to check whether a number is divisible by 5 and 11 or not.
Sample Input
Input as : 
Enter a number : 55
Sample Output
Output as : 
55 is divisible by both 5 and 11

Question 3.


OddEven
Develop a C program that takes an integer input and checks whether it is even or odd. Print "Even" if it's even, and "Odd" if it's odd.  (Use Only If )
Sample Input
Input as : 
Enter a Integer : 20
Sample Output
Output as : 
Even
Explanation
[Use Only If ]

Question 4.

HourFormat
Write a C program that takes an hour in the 24-hour format as input and identifies the time of day as "Morning," "Afternoon," "Evening," or "Night." Implement this using a series of if statements. Ensure that the program also checks for invalid input, displaying an appropriate message if the entered hour is not within the valid range (0-23). Present the program with a suitable title and header for clarity.
Sample Input
Input as :
Enter the hour (24-hour format): 13
Sample Output
Output as :
It's Afternoon.


Question 5.

CheckVowel
Develop a C program that reads a character from the user and prints "Vowel" if the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u or their uppercase equivalents), and "Consonant" if it's a consonant.
Sample Input
Input as : 
Enter a character : I
Sample Output
Output as :
Vowel

Question 1.

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){

    int a,b;
    scanf("%d %d",&a,&b);

    if(a==b){

    printf("Equal");
    return 0;
    }
    printf("Not Equal");

    return 0;
}


Question 2.

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    if( ((n%5 == 0) && ( n%11 == 0) )) {                               
        printf("%d is divisible by both 5 and 11",n);
        return 0;
    }
        printf("%d is Not divisible by both 5 and 11",n);

    return 0;

// Second Method for question 2.

    #include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    
    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    
    if( ((n%5 == 0) && ( n%11 == 0) )) 
        printf("%d is divisible by both 5 and 11",n);
    
    if( !((n%5 == 0) && ( n%11 == 0) )) 
        printf("%d is Not divisible by both 5 and 11",n);

        return 0 ;


}




Question 3.

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){

    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    if( n % 2 == 0) {
        printf("Even");
        return 0;
    }

    printf("Odd");

    return 0;
}

Question 4.

#include<stdio.h>
int main(){

    int n;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    if((n >= 4) && (n <= 12)) 
    printf("It's Morning.");
    if((n >= 12) && (n < 16)) 
    printf("It's Afternoon.");
    if((n >= 16) && (n < 20)) 
    printf("It's Evening.");
    if((n >= 20) && (n <= 23)) 
    printf("It's Night.");
    

    return 0;
}


Question 5.


#include<stdio.h>
int main(){

    char ch;
    scanf("%c",&ch);
    if(((ch == 'a') || (ch == 'A') || (ch == 'e') || (ch == 'E') || (ch == 'i') || (ch == 'I') || (ch == 'o') || (ch == 'O') || (ch == 'u') || (ch == 'U') )) {
        printf("Vowel");
        return 0;
    }
     printf("Consonant");
    return 0;
